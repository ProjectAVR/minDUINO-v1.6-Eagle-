A small footprint Arduino Clone, originally designed as an educationl tool.

[Edited text from Projectavr.com]
If you look online you will find a myriad of Arduino™ clones of all different shapes and sizes. So why would I want to produce yet more? I was inspired to create the minDUINO boards because my friends daughter, I will call her Amelia, had found an interest in electronics. Amelia’s father and I had given her several things to build, commercially available kits, but I wanted to encourage her to experiment. Since I have a familiarity with AVRs and Arduino™, I elected to follow that path.

The minDUINO is designed to be easy to assemble, so it is a two layer through-hole design, and has no SMD components. It has headers for FTDI, ICSP and GPIO breakouts.

The original designs were carried out with EagleCAD.

This repository holds the Eagle files and the final Gerbers which can all be used to create physical boards.
